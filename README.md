## About

A Website that allows the user to find partners to play games together. The user chooses a Game and then submits their Username, Experience, Discord, if they use Voice Chat or not and what days of the week and time they usually play.

The back-end is built using Node and Express with TypeScript. Prisma ORM handles the connection with the SQLite Database.

The front-end uses Vite to set up the work environment, with React and TypeScript. TailwindCSS is used as a plugin for PostCSS to handle styling for the project and Axios is then used to handle the API requests.
